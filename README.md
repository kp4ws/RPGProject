# RPGProject

## About ##
This is an RPG project that I've been building in Unity by following Gamedev.tv's RPG bundle tutorial course located here: [https://www.gamedev.tv/p/unity-rpg-course-bundle-inventory-quests-dialogue ](https://www.gamedev.tv/p/unity-rpg) 

## Goal ##
My goal is to take what I've learned from this course and apply it into my daily programming practices.
